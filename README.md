# MovieTime iOS App

This application lists all the latest movies and allows user to search and read about the movie, actors and crew members.

- It allows the user to add movies to his watchlist and also he could plan to watch movie and create/delete a remainder in iPhoneâ€™s calendar application.
- It also allows the user to read reviews given by other users on a particular movie and also post his review on that movie.
- To use this app user has to register/login with email and password
- I used firebase for user authentication and real time database.
- This app uses TMDB API.( https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started)
